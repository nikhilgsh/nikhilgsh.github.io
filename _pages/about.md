I am a research fellow in the Center for Computational Mathematics (CCM) at the Flatiron Institute. I completed my PhD in the Statistics department at UC Berkeley where I was advised by <a href='https://binyu.stat.berkeley.edu/'>Bin Yu</a> and <a href='https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~songmei/'>Song Mei</a>. I have also collaborated with <a href='http://misha.belkin-wang.org/'>Misha Belkin</a> at UC San Diego. Previously, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Caltech where I worked with <a href='http://www.yisongyue.com/'>Yisong Yue</a>.

I am broadly interested in developing a better foundational understanding of **deep learning** as well as improving real-world systems. Currently, I am particularly interested in questions related to model **scaling** and **optimization**.
